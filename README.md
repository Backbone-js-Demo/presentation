##DESCRIPTION
This presentation was created as a student project for the the 2014 Plattforms & Frameworks class at the DHBW Mannheim.  
This presentation was created to serve as a short introduction into the javascript framework  [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/). It consists of a general summary of the purpose and features of Backbone.js and a small example of how Backbone.js can be used.
The example application for this presentation is the well-known game ["Snake"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_%28video_game%29) in which the player can control a square representing the snake. The player has to steer the snake towards the food represented by a different coloured square without touching the borders of the playing field.
If the player succeeds in steering the snake to the food, the snake grows by one square. The speed in which the snake is moving is increased as the game progresses.
